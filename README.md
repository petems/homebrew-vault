# Homebrew Vault Formula

[Homebrew][] formulae for Vault, that uses the [pre-built releases][] rather than building it ourselves.

[homebrew]: http://brew.sh/

[pre-built releases]: https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html

## DEPRECATED - Use the Official HashiCorp Tap

This formula is no longer needed as Hashicorp [now maintains their own official tap], which provides pre-built downloads for all HashiCorp products.

```
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/vault
```
